The Altria challenge involves doing social media sentiment analysis related to brands and products. It's open-ended. You can pick any company or any of their brands for the work. What we're looking for are the most interesting algorithms and tools you can create to gauge how people feel about a brand or a product. For example, how do people think about SpaceX and Tesla before and after tweets from Elon Musk? Your solution must be checked into github. We have four Nintendo Switches to give away for the top team and a variety of Amazon gift cards for the runners-up. Above all, have fun and come check us out to talk about internships.
